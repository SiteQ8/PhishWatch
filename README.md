## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SiteQ8/phishguard.git
   cd phish_detector
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install OpenSquat (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atenreiro/opensquat.git
   cd opensquat
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd ..
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the dashboard:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Starting Monitoring
1. Click the "Start Monitoring" button in the dashboard header
2. The system will begin monitoring CertStream and OpenSquat feeds
3. Detected domains will appear in real-time in the detection feed

### Understanding Risk Scores
- **90-100 (Critical)**: High confidence phishing domains, immediate action required
- **70-89 (High)**: Strong phishing indicators, blocking recommended
- **50-69 (Medium)**: Suspicious characteristics, monitoring recommended
- **0-49 (Low)**: Minor suspicious elements, continued observation

### Filtering Detections
- Use the risk level filter to focus on high-priority threats
- Filter by source (CertStream vs OpenSquat) to analyze detection methods
- Export filtered results for further analysis

### Managing Keywords
- Add custom keywords to monitor specific brands or terms
- Keywords are used by both CertStream and OpenSquat for targeted detection
- Remove keywords that generate too many false positives

```

### Data Flow
1. **CertStream** provides real-time SSL certificate data via WebSocket
2. **OpenSquat** scans for newly registered suspicious domains
3. **Domain Analyzer** performs technical analysis (DNS, WHOIS, patterns)
4. **Threat Classifier** calculates risk scores using multiple factors
5. **Flask-SocketIO** broadcasts detections to connected clients in real-time
6. **Dashboard** displays live feed with filtering and analysis tools

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Flask configuration
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Monitoring settings
CERTSTREAM_URL=wss://certstream.calidog.io/
OPENSQUAT_SCAN_INTERVAL=1800

# Risk thresholds
CRITICAL_RISK_THRESHOLD=90
HIGH_RISK_THRESHOLD=70
MEDIUM_RISK_THRESHOLD=50
```

### Custom Keywords
Edit the keywords list in `config/settings.py` or manage them through the dashboard:
```python
DEFAULT_KEYWORDS = [
    'paypal', 'microsoft', 'google', 'amazon', 'apple',
    'your-company-name', 'your-brand'
]
```

```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints in production
- **Authentication**: Add user authentication for sensitive deployments
- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production environments
- **Data Retention**: Configure appropriate data retention policies
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to admin functions

## 🤝 Integration with Security Tools

### SIEM Integration
Export detection data to your SIEM using the CSV/JSON export feature or API endpoints.

### Email Alerts
Integrate with email systems to send alerts for critical detections:
```python
# Add to your monitoring loop
if detection['risk_score'] >= CRITICAL_THRESHOLD:
    send_email_alert(detection)
```

### DNS Sinkholes
Use detection data to automatically update DNS sinkholes:
```python
# Example integration
def update_dns_sinkhole(domain):
    # Add domain to your DNS filtering system
    pass
```

## 📊 Performance

### Scalability
- Handles 200+ certificates per second from CertStream
- Processes thousands of domains per hour
- Real-time updates to multiple connected clients
- Configurable retention (default: 1000 recent detections)

### Resource Usage
- CPU: Moderate (depends on detection volume)
- Memory: ~100MB base + ~1MB per 1000 detections
- Network: Continuous WebSocket connection to CertStream
- Storage: Minimal (in-memory storage by default)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**CertStream Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Check network connectivity
curl -I https://certstream.calidog.io
# Verify WebSocket connection
python -c "import certstream; print('CertStream available')"
```

**OpenSquat Not Found:**
```bash
# Install OpenSquat manually
git clone https://github.com/atenreiro/opensquat.git
# Update path in opensquat_integration.py
```

**High False Positives:**
- Adjust risk thresholds in configuration
- Refine keyword list
- Update similarity detection algorithms
